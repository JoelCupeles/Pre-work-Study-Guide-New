# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide is a project designed to help students prepare for a specific program such as HTML, CSSS, Git, and JavaScript by providing them with the necessary background knowledge and materials. The guide includes a schedule for completing the prework, a list of topics covered, and information about assessments and support resources.

My motivation for building this project was to help students be better prepared for the program and increase their chances of success. By providing a clear and organized study guide, students can easily understand what is expected of them and can plan their studies accordingly.

The problem this project solves is the lack of structure and organization for prework materials. Without a guide, students may struggle to know what to study and when, which can lead to confusion and frustration. By providing a clear and organized study guide, students can easily understand what is expected of them and can plan their studies accordingly.

Through building this project, I learned the importance of clear and concise communication, the importance of providing students with the right resources, and the value of creating a structured study plan.
